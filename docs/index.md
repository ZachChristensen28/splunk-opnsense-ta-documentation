The OPNsense Add-on allows Splunk data administrators to map the OPNsense® Firewall events to the CIM enabling the data to be used with other Splunk Apps, such as the [OPNsense App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5372).

This Splunk Add-on is community driven and not affiliated with the official [OPNsense® Firewall](https://opnsense.org). As such, the included documentation does not contain information on how to get started with the OPNsense firewall. Rather, this documentation serves as a guide to help get data into Splunk. Please visit [https://opnsense.org](https://opnsense.org) for documentation on installing/configuring your own OPNsense firewall.

## Assumptions

This documentation assumes the following:

1. You have a working OPNsense firewall.
2. You have a working Splunk environment.
3. Basic understanding of Splunk and OPNsense.
